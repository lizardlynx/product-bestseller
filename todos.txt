- graphql-request add interfaces
- do logging
-+ improve categories unification
+ lookup decorators, may be some help for functions in api classes
+ decide what to do with process request
- metatitle, metakeyword, metadescription auchan for product
+ format restApi responses
+ parallellism when load both?
- pipe
- slugs
+ add limit to mysql queries


+ handle rest api status codes not ok (like in product.js file)
+ check if chart compare prices works and fix data, transfered to it

+ add usage of artificial intelligence to connect products
+ add price prediction!! (need data)

- add related products
- add card with discount -> calculate prices based 
- include api count how to get to?
+ interpolation for data, where grabber failed
- price comparing to dollar !
- prediction with neural network

- description why we do not use interpolation for prediction
- extrapolating the interpolation cannot help us predict the pattern, and can get horribly wrong - it already does

o Linear regression is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. 
o It aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship within the existing data.

+ Extrapolation is about predicting beyond existing data based on observed trends, while regression is about modeling and understanding the relationship between variables within the data.
+  Polynomial extrapolation is typically done by means of Lagrange interpolation or using Newton's method of finite differences to create a Newton series that fits the data. 
+ Newton's Divided Differences
+ create correlation heatmap?

- newton and lagrange interpolation broken??
- fix prediction algorithm
- broken list - fix it
+ add api school holidays
+ add api https://holidayapi.com/countries/ua/2022
- add weather api https://open-meteo.com/

- do smth with new apis
- disconnect products
